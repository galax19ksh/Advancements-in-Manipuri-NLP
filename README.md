# Advancements-in-Manipuri-NLP
My repo "Advancements in Manipuri NLP" will provide a comprehensive study of research papers regarding Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and developments of Manipuri language

## Introduction
Manipuri (Meiteilon), a language of Tibo-Burman origin is the official language and lingua franca of the northeast Indian state of Manipur. Despite its status as one of India's 22 Scheduled languages and a communication tool for over 1.5 million speakers across states like Manipur, Assam and Tripura, Manipuri remains a low resource language, impeded by sparse annotated data and technological advancements. While Manipuri boasts a rich morphology, complex agglutinative structure, and unique SOV word order, it also presents a thrilling challenge for NLP researchers. This is further compounded by its monosyllabic and compounding nature. Despite these complexities, researchers have made commendable strides in NLP applications like Part-of-Speech tagging, Name Entity Recognition, and machine translation. 

Interestingly, Manipuri uses two writing systems: the borrowed Bengali script and its own indigenous Meitei Mayek. While most research has focused on Bengali script, Meitei Mayek holds immense potential for future exploration. It's clear that significant progress is needed for both scripts to unlock the full potential of Manipuri NLP. This github repo will serve as the ultimate destination for the analysis of the NLP applications, approaches, challenges and future directions of Manipuri. I will post all papers and updates there has been in this realm with a summary and analysis.
