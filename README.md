# Advancements-in-Manipuri-NLP
My repo "Advancements in Manipuri NLP" will provide a comprehensive study of research papers regarding Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and developments of Manipuri language. It could be regarded as one of those "awesome" github repos for curated stuffs. 

**Note:** This is a work in progress. I will be updating every now and then.


## Introduction
Manipuri (Meiteilon), a language of Tibo-Burman origin is the official language and lingua franca of the northeast Indian state of Manipur. Despite its status as one of India's 22 Scheduled languages and a communication tool for over 1.5 million speakers across states like Manipur, Assam and Tripura, Manipuri remains a low resource language, impeded by sparse annotated data and technological advancements. While Manipuri boasts a rich morphology, complex agglutinative structure, and unique SOV word order, it also presents a thrilling challenge for NLP researchers. This is further compounded by its monosyllabic and compounding nature. Despite these complexities, researchers have made commendable strides in NLP applications like Part-of-Speech tagging, Name Entity Recognition, and machine translation. 

Interestingly, Manipuri uses two writing systems: the borrowed Bengali script and its own indigenous Meitei Mayek. While most research has focused on Bengali script, Meitei Mayek holds immense potential for future exploration. It's clear that significant progress is needed for both scripts to unlock the full potential of Manipuri NLP. This github repo will serve as the ultimate destination for the analysis of the NLP applications, approaches, challenges and future directions of Manipuri. I will post all papers and updates there has been in this realm with a summary and analysis.

|Devi et al.,2022 | [An Analysis of Phrase based SMT for English to Manipuri Language](https://aircconline.com/csit/papers/vol12/csit121904.pdf) |This paper presents a phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system from English to Manipuri, leveraging the Moses toolkit and Bengali script, and evaluates its performance using the BLEU metric on tourism, agriculture, and entertainment corpora. |
|Devi et al.,2023    |[An Exploratory Study of SMT Versus NMT for the Resource Constraint English to Manipuri Translation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-3761-5_31)   |This study investigates and compares the performance of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) methods for English-to-Manipuri translation using BLEU, Meteor, TER, and F-measure scores as well as expert evaluation, to determine the most suitable approach for low-resource language pairs. |
| Singh et al.,2023    | [Subwords to Word Back Composition for Morphologically Rich Languages in Neural Machine Translation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.paclic-1.69/)     | This paper proposes a novel approach for neural machine translation (NMT) in morphologically rich languages, segmenting words into morphemes and composing word representations from them, showing improved translation accuracy over baseline subword models in Manipuri-English, Tamil-English, and Marathi-English translation tasks, highlighting the importance of leveraging word boundary information and interrelationships between word morphemes in NMT. |
|Lalrempuii et al.,2023     | [Low-Resource Indic Languages Translation Using Multilingual Approaches](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-6690-5_27)   |This study explores the effectiveness of multilingual pre-trained transformers—mBART and mT5—on low-resource Indic languages, including Hindi, Bengali, Assamese, Manipuri, and Mizo, comparing their performance with multiway multilingual translation trained from scratch using a one-to-many and many-to-one approach, highlighting the scalability of multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) and its potential for improving translation quality in low-resource language settings.  |
|Pal et al.,2023   | [Findings of the WMT 2023 Shared Task on Low-Resource Indic Language](https://aclanthology.org/2023.wmt-1.56.pdf)    |This paper outlines the outcomes of the low-resource Indic language translation task conducted alongside the Eighth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) 2023, where participants were tasked with developing machine translation systems for English-Assamese, English-Mizo, English-Khasi, and English-Manipuri language pairs. The evaluation of these systems will include both automatic metrics (BLEU, TER, RIBES, COMET, ChrF) and human assessment, utilizing the IndicNE-Corp1.0 dataset, comprising parallel and monolingual corpora for northeastern Indic languages like Assamese, Mizo, Khasi, and Manipuri.  |
|Singh et al.,2023     | [NITS-CNLP Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation Systems of English-Manipuri Language Pair](https://aclanthology.org/2023.wmt-1.92.pdf)     | This paper presents a transformer-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system developed by NITS-CNLP for the English-Manipuri language pair, achieving BLEU scores of 22.75 for English to Manipuri and 26.92 for Manipuri to English translations, along with character level n-gram F-score (chrF), RIBES, TER, and COMET evaluations.  |
|Agrawal et al.,2023     | [Neural Machine Translation for English - Manipuri and English - Assamese](https://aclanthology.org/2023.wmt-1.86.pdf)  |In the WMT23 shared task: low resource Indic language translation challenge, our team, ATULYA-NITS, utilized the NMT transformer model for English to/from Assamese and English to/from Manipuri language translation, achieving BLEU scores of 15.02 and 18.7 for English to Manipuri and Manipuri to English translations respectively, as well as 5.47 for English to Assamese and 8.5 for Assamese to English translations.  |
