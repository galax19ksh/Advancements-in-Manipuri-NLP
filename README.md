# Advancements-in-Manipuri-NLP
My repo "Advancements in Manipuri NLP" will provide a comprehensive study of research papers regarding Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and developments of Manipuri language

## Introduction
Manipuri (Meiteilon), a language of Tibo-Burman origin is the official language and lingua franca of the northeast Indian state of Manipur. Despite its status as one of India's 22 Scheduled languages and a communication tool for over 1.5 million speakers across states like Manipur, Assam and Tripura, Manipuri remains a low resource language, impeded by sparse annotated data and technological advancements. While Manipuri boasts a rich morphology, complex agglutinative structure, and unique SOV word order, it also presents a thrilling challenge for NLP researchers. This is further compounded by its monosyllabic and compounding nature. Despite these complexities, researchers have made commendable strides in NLP applications like Part-of-Speech tagging, Name Entity Recognition, and machine translation. 

Interestingly, Manipuri uses two writing systems: the borrowed Bengali script and its own indigenous Meitei Mayek. While most research has focused on Bengali script, Meitei Mayek holds immense potential for future exploration. It's clear that significant progress is needed for both scripts to unlock the full potential of Manipuri NLP. This github repo will serve as the ultimate destination for the analysis of the NLP applications, approaches, challenges and future directions of Manipuri. I will post all papers and updates there has been in this realm with a summary and analysis.

| Singh et al.,2005     | [Manipuri Morphological Analyzer](https://www.academia.edu/1150157/Manipuri_Morphological_Analyzer)    | utilizes a Manipuri-English dictionary for identifying word morphemes and an affix dictionary for categorizing affix types.
| Singh et al.,2006 | [Word Class and Sentence Type Identification in Manipuri Morophological Analyzer](https://www.academia.edu/1150153/Word_Class_and_Sentence_Type_Identification_in_Manipuri_Morophological_Analyzer)     | The developed Manipuri Morphological Analyzer, utilizing a Manipuri-English dictionary for root words and an affix dictionary for affix types, yields surface-level word analysis aiding in the development of a Manipuri-English machine translation system, showcasing promising results.     |
| Nongmeikapam et al.,2012     | [Manipuri Morpheme Identification](https://aclanthology.org/W12-5008.pdf) | This approach used involves segmenting Manipuri words into syllables and employing 2-gram analysis with Standard Deviation technique for morpheme identification, achieving recall of 59.80%, precision of 83.02%, and an f-score of 69.52%.   |
| Singha et al.,2012     | [Morphological Analysis for Manipuri Nominal Category Words with Finite State Techniques](https://research.ijcaonline.org/volume58/number15/pxc3883688.pdf) | The paper proposes a suffix stripping approach for analyzing nominal category Manipuri words, utilizing finite state machines to model morphotactics and converting non-deterministic finite automata to deterministic finite automata, facilitating morphological analysis without a lexicon. | 
| Singha et al.,2013    | [Morphotactics of Manipuri Adjectives: A FiniteState Approach](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=4aaa66c6f90c51a9feb8ddc9629548b7d7c3c500)     |This paper presents a constrained finite-state model to represent the morphotactic rule of Manipuri adjective word forms, which are derived from verb roots using specific affixes, with rules composed to describe their simple agglutinative morphology and more complex structures, resulting in a system capable of analyzing and recognizing adjectives through finite-state networks, utilizing a root lexicon and an affix dictionary.  |
